What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually commit permit to choose the version we want to keep and update,
    but, automatically saving is also useful to avoid loosing our work if
    something wrong happen. Using the 2 options is a good way to work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log display all commits done since starting of project, git diff allows
    us to compare commits using the commit key

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can easily recall history and go back in our project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i'll try using git for all the projects from Front-end Web Dev nano ;)
